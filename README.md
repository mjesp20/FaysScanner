# Raid scanner addon

Currently supports two commands

/fayscan for a csv of all enchants on items for raid members

/fayplan for an output of each raid members name and class, to be used in https://github.com/mjesp20/FaysPlanner/releases/tag/1.2

Checks for superwow. If detected will output as a file, and if not will give a window to copy the data directly, to be pasted into a file manually
